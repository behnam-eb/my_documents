The iptables firewall uses tables to organize its rules. These tables classify rules according to the type of decisions they are used to make.
For instance, if a rule deals with network address translation, it will be put into the nat table. If the rule is used to decide whether to 
allow the packet to continue to its destination, it would probably be added to the filter table.

There are five netfilter hooks that programs can register with. As packets progress through the stack, they will trigger the kernel modules that
have registered with these hooks. The hooks that a packet will trigger depends on whether the packet is incoming or outgoing, the packet’s 
destination, and whether the packet was dropped or rejected at a previous point.

The following hooks represent various well-defined points in the networking stack:
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING ========> This hook will be triggered by any incoming traffic very soon after entering the network stack. This hook is processed before 
                             any routing decisions have been made regarding where to send the packet.
NF_IP_LOCAL_IN ===========> This hook is triggered after an incoming packet has been routed if the packet is destined for the local system.
NF_IP_FORWARD ============> This hook is triggered after an incoming packet has been routed if the packet is to be forwarded to another host.
NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT ==========> This hook is triggered by any locally created outbound traffic as soon it hits the network stack.
NF_IP_POST_ROUTING =======> This hook is triggered by any outgoing or forwarded traffic after routing has taken place and just before being put out on the wire.


Within each iptables table, rules are further organized within separate “chains”. While tables are defined by the general aim of the rules they
hold, the built-in chains represent the netfilter hooks which trigger them. Chains basically determine when rules will be evaluated.
As you can see, the names of the built-in chains mirror the names of the netfilter hooks they are associated with:

PREROUTING ===========> Triggered by the NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook.
INPUT ================> Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN hook.
FORWARD ==============> Triggered by the NF_IP_FORWARD hook.
OUTPUT ===============> Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT hook.
POSTROUTING ==========> Triggered by the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook.
