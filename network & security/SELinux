SELinux has three modes:

Enforcing: SELinux allows access based on SELinux policy rules.
Permissive: SELinux only logs actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode.
Disabled: No SELinux policy is loaded.
By default, in CentOS 7, SELinux is enabled and in enforcing mode.

$ sestatus
$ sudo setenforce 0   => temporarily change the SELinux mode from targeted to permissive
$ vim /etc/selinux/config   => SELINUX=disabled => to do permanently => after that reboot the system
