Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible
with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot 
time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic.

Systemd introduces the concept of systemd units. These units are represented by unit configuration files located 
in one of the directories :
* /lib/systemd/system/
* /run/systemd/system/
* /etc/systemd/system/
and encapsulate information about system services, listening sockets, and other objects that are relevant to the init system.

Available systemd Unit Types:
  Service unit => .service => A system service.
  Target unit => .target => A group of systemd units.
  Automount unit => .automount => A file system automount point.
  Device unit => .device => A device file recognized by the kernel.
  Mount unit => .mount => A file system mount point.
  Path unit => .path => A file or directory in a file system.
  Scope unit => .scope => An externally created process.
  Slice unit => .slice => A group of hierarchically organized units that manage system processes.
  Snapshot unit => .snapshot => A saved state of the systemd manager.
  Socket unit => .socket => An inter-process communication socket.
  Swap unit => .swap => A swap device or a swap file.
  Timer unit => .timer => A systemd timer.
  
  The default configuration of systemd is defined during the compilation and it can be found in systemd configuration file at /etc/systemd/system.conf.

                    [...].target.wants

/etc/systemd/system/....   -> link to /lib/systemd/system/....         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we enable a service, it creates a link in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/[...].service   to 
the service file in /lib/systemd/system/[...].service
