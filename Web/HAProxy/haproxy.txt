HAProxy, which stands for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open source software TCP/HTTP Load Balancer and proxying solution which can be run on Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD. Its most common use is to improve the performance and reliability of a server environment by distributing the workload across multiple servers (e.g. web, application, database).

** Access Control List (ACL)
In relation to load balancing, ACLs are used to test some condition and perform an action (e.g. select a server, or block a request) based on the test result. Use of ACLs allows flexible network traffic forwarding based on a variety of factors like pattern-matching and the number of connections to a backend, for example.

Example of an ACL:
      acl url_blog path_beg /blog
This ACL is matched if the path of a userâ€™s request begins with /blog. This would match a request of http://yourdomain.com/blog/blog-entry-1, for example.

** Backend
A backend is a set of servers that receives forwarded requests. Backends are defined in the backend section of the HAProxy configuration. In its most basic form, a backend can be defined by:

which load balance algorithm to use
a list of servers and ports
A backend can contain one or many servers in it. Generally speaking, adding more servers to your backend will increase your potential load capacity by spreading the load over multiple servers. Increased reliability is also achieved through this manner, in case some of your backend servers become unavailable.

Example:
      backend web-backend
         balance roundrobin
         server web1 web1.yourdomain.com:80 check
         server web2 web2.yourdomain.com:80 check
         
      backend blog-backend
         balance roundrobin
         mode http
         server blog1 blog1.yourdomain.com:80 check
         server blog1 blog1.yourdomain.com:80 check
balance roundrobin line specifies the load balancing algorithm, which is detailed in the Load Balancing Algorithms section.
mode http specifies that layer 7 proxying will be used, which is explained in the Types of Load Balancing section.
The check option at the end of the server directives specifies that health checks should be performed on those backend servers.
