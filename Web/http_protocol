The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. 
HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of 
the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

**HTTP Request:
    An HTTP request is the way internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website.
    
    Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information.
    A typical HTTP request contains:
          1. HTTP version type
          2. a URL
          3. an HTTP method
              An HTTP method, sometimes referred to as an HTTP verb, indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from the queried server.
              For example, two of the most common HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; a ‘GET’ request expects information back in return 
              (usually in the form of a website), while a ‘POST’ request typically indicates that the client is submitting information to the 
              web server (such as form information, e.g. a submitted username and password).
          4. HTTP request headers
              HTTP headers contain text information stored in key-value pairs, and they are included in every HTTP request (and response, more
              on that later). These headers communicate core information, such as what browser the client is using what data is being requested.
              Example of HTTP request headers from Google Chrome's network tab:
                  Request Headers:
                  :authority: www.isna.ir
                  :method: GET
                  :path: /
                  :scheme: https
                  accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
                  accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
                  accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9,fa;q=0.8
                  cache-control: no-cache
                  cookie: __arcsco=f435fe06b7db126a52c5897267465704
                  pragma: no-cache

          5. Optional HTTP body.
              The body of a request is the part that contains the ‘body’ of information the request is transferring. The body of an HTTP request contains any 
              information being submitted to the web server, such as a username and password, or any other data entered into a form.
              
**HTTP Response:        
    An HTTP response is what web clients (often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request. These responses communicate valuable
    information based on what was asked for in the HTTP request.

    A typical HTTP response contains:
        1. an HTTP status code
            HTTP status codes are 3-digit codes most often used to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. Status codes are broken 
            into the following 5 blocks:
                1. 1xx Informational
                2. 2xx Success
                3. 3xx Redirection
                4. 4xx Client Error
                5. 5xx Server Error
        2. HTTP response headers
            Much like an HTTP request, an HTTP response comes with headers that convey important information such as the language and format of the data being
            sent in the response body
            Example of HTTP response headers from Google Chrome's network tab:
                    Response Headers:
                    ar-atime: 0.067
                    ar-cache: BYPASS
                    ar-poweredby: Arvan Cloud (arvancloud.com)
                    ar-request-id: 34a2a10eb51edb77195470d8c056e7bd
                    ar-sid: 2001
                    content-encoding: gzip
                    content-security-policy: upgrade-insecure-requests
                    content-type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
                    date: Sun, 28 Aug 2022 05:53:27 GMT
                    server: ArvanCloud
                    vary: Accept-Encoding
                    vary: accept-encoding
                    x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block            
        3. optional HTTP body
            Successful HTTP responses to ‘GET’ requests generally have a body which contains the requested information. In most web requests, this is HTML
            data which a web browser will translate into a web page.
